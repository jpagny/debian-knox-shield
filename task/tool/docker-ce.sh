### Task for Installing Docker Community Edition (CE)
#
# Function..........: task_add_docker-ce
# Description.......: Installs Docker CE on the system and performs post-installation actions to ensure that 
#                     Docker is properly configured and operational. This includes checking prerequisites, 
#                     installing Docker, adding a user to the Docker group for secure operation, and verifying 
#                     the installation with a test container.
# Parameters........: 
#               - None directly. The function uses predefined local variables for task name, root requirement, 
#                     prerequisites, actions, post-actions, and task type.
# Returns...........: 
#               - 0 (OK): If Docker CE is successfully installed, configured, and verified.
#               - 1 (NOK): If the installation or configuration process fails at any point.

### Check Prerequisites for Docker CE Installation
#
# Function..........: check_prerequisites_add_docker-ce
# Description.......: Prepares the system for Docker CE installation. This includes installing necessary 
#                     packages like apt-transport-https, ca-certificates, curl, and software-properties-common. 
#                     It also involves adding Docker's official GPG key, setting up the Docker repository, 
#                     updating the package database, and installing Docker CE.
# Parameters........: 
#               - None. The function handles all the steps necessary to prepare for Docker CE installation.
# Returns...........: 
#               - 0 (OK): If all prerequisites are successfully installed and configured, and Docker CE is 
#                          installed.
#               - 1 (NOK): If any step in the process fails, including package installation, repository setup, 
#                           or Docker CE installation.

### Run Action for Docker CE Installation and Configuration
#
# Function..........: run_action_add_docker-ce
# Description.......: Secures the Docker installation by creating a new non-root user and adding them to the Docker 
#                     group. The function prompts for a new username and password, confirms the credentials with the user, 
#                     creates the new user with the provided credentials, and adds them to the Docker group. It also 
#                     ensures that the Docker group exists before adding the user to it.
# Parameters........: 
#               - None. The function uses interactive prompts to gather input for the new user's credentials.
# Returns...........: 
#               - 0 (OK): If a new user is successfully created and added to the Docker group.
#               - 1 (NOK): If any part of the process fails, such as user creation or adding the user to the Docker group.

### Post-Installation Actions for Docker CE
#
# Function..........: post_actions_add_docker-ce
# Description.......: Verifies the Docker CE installation by running the 'hello-world' Docker container. This function 
#                     tests if Docker is correctly installed and operational by executing a simple, lightweight container. 
#                     The successful execution of the 'hello-world' container is a common method to confirm that Docker 
#                     can pull images from Docker Hub and run containers.
# Parameters........: 
#               - None. The function performs the verification without additional parameters.
# Returns...........: 
#               - 0 (OK): If the 'hello-world' container runs successfully, indicating a functional Docker setup.
#               - 1 (NOK): If the 'hello-world' container fails to run, suggesting an issue with the Docker installation.
