## Description

**Secure your Debian server with ease**

Debian knox shield is a robust and modular tool designed to enhance the security of your Debian server. This build script empowers users to secure their server environments effectively, integrating a suite of customizable scripts and security measures. With Debian Knox Shield, fortify your server against vulnerabilities and tailor the security to your specific needs.

## Context

I developed Debian Knox Shield after subscribing to a VPS server and realizing the scarcity of repositories offering post-installation Debian security scripts that were either not very modular or didn't meet my specific needs. This project is a personal journey into enhancing server security while learning and evolving in the field.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jpagny/debian-knox-shield.git`
2. Make the build script executable: `chmod +x build.sh`
3. Execute the build script: `./build.sh`

## Project Structure

| Dossier   | Sous-RÃ©pertoire   | Description |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `config/` |                   | Contains default configuration files with tasks organized in the proper procedural order. |
| `core/`   |                   | The core of the project. Modify only if you are certain of the changes. |
| `output/` |                   | Contains the output script post-build, which should be executed on your server. |
| `task/`   |                   | Holds all the scripts. Users can choose which to use, and add their own scripts to the configuration. |
|           | `firewall/`       | Contains all tasks related to firewall management.  |
|           | `network/`        | Contains all tasks related to network management and configuration. |
|           | `scheduler/`      | Contains all tasks related to task scheduling and event management.|
|           | `system/`         | Contains all tasks related to overall system management and configuration. |
|           | `tool/`           | Contains all tools and utilities supporting script development and execution. |
|           | `tool_secure/`    | Contains all tools and utilities specifically designed for enhancing server security. |
|           | `user/`           | Contains all tasks and scripts related to user account management and permissions. |
| `tool/`   |                   | Tools to assist in rapid script development. |


## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Task

To create a task, run the following command from the root of the project: 

```shell
tool/build_task.sh "task_name" "folder_name" "need_prerequisites" "need_post_action"
```

**For example:**

```shell
`tool/build_task.sh "hello_world" "message" true true`
```

This command will create a task in `task/message/hello_world.sh` with a ready-made template that includes prerequisite functions and post-action steps.


```shell
#!/bin/bash

# import
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
source "$(dirname "$0")/../core/00_variable_global.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/../core/01_logger.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/../core/02_execute_task.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/../core/03_utils.sh"

task_hello_world() {
  
  local name="hello_world"
  local isRootRequired=true
  local prereq="check_prerequisites_$name"
  local actions="run_action_$name"
  local postActions="post_actions_$name"
  local task_type=""

  if ! execute_and_check "$name" $isRootRequired "$prereq" "$actions" "$postActions" "$task_type"; then
    log_error "hello_world failed."
    return "$NOK"
  fi

  log_info "hello_world has been successfully hello_worldx."
  
  return "$OK"
}

check_prerequisites_hello_world() {
    # add your prerequisites here
    return "$OK"
}

run_action_hello_world() {
    # add your action here
    echo "hello world !"
    return "$OK"
}

post_actions_hello_world() {
    # add your post action here
    return "$OK"
}

# Run the task to hello_world
task_hello_world
```

The script generated by the `tool/build_task.sh` command will include or exclude certain functions based on the options you specify. 

For instance, if `need_prerequisites` and `need_post_action` are set to `false`, the functions `check_prerequisites_hello_world` and `post_actions_hello_world` will not be included in the script.
