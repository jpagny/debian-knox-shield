## Description

**Secure your Debian server with ease**

Debian knox shield is a robust and modular tool designed to enhance the security of your Debian server. This build script empowers users to secure their server environments effectively, integrating a suite of customizable scripts and security measures. With Debian Knox Shield, fortify your server against vulnerabilities and tailor the security to your specific needs.

## Context

I developed Debian Knox Shield after subscribing to a VPS server and realizing the scarcity of repositories offering post-installation Debian security scripts that were either not very modular or didn't meet my specific needs. This project is a personal journey into enhancing server security while learning and evolving in the field.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jpagny/debian-knox-shield.git`
2. Make the build script executable: `chmod +x build.sh`
3. Execute the build script: `./build.sh`
